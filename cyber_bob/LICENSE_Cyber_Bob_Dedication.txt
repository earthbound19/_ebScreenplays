The Cyber Bob dramatic concept and screenplays which I write and deposit at various places on the internet are my original work, and/or the work of other contributors who have by submission of their work work to this collection expressly and irrevocably dedicated them to the Public Domain, as I also do, for these purposes: So that any one may freely adapt them, create other works inspired by them, for any purpose commercial or non-commercial, and particularly, to feel free to produce from the scripts at any production level (from low-end amateur video to high-end, using simple hand drawn cartoons or CGI), and also in a spirit of very open adaptation for any purpose, including very flexibly altering the ages, ethnicities, and genders of characters--maybe even their names ("BOB" could for example be changed to "BARBARA"). Part of the intent also is the possibility of a largely open-ended web series, which anyone may contribute to. (Drastically changing character names wouldn't work for that intent of any kind of continuity.) A git repository folder of these screenplays which anyone may contribute to is at: https://github.com/earthbound19/_ebScreenplays/tree/master/cyber_bob See also the README at: https://github.com/earthbound19/_ebScreenplays/blob/master/README.md
