SCREENPLAY CONVENTIONS AND UNIVERSE LICENSE.

SCREENPLAY CONVENTIONS.
All screenplays in this universe should link to this document
to explain matters and introduce characters (to conserve virtual
breath and actual space), by including this URL in a note:
http://s.earthbound.io/CyberBobUniverse

Follows a list of effects to be referenced (for brevity)
in any screenplay, and dramatis personae (by way of introduction
to any new reader) :

- CYBER BOB CHARACTER INTRODUCTION
CYBER BOB, 40, a white man,
a mild, goofy,
fairly daft pawn of a soul

- MARGARET CHARACTER INTRODUCTION
MARGARET, 37, a white woman,
amicable, mild, curious, and very sharp

- CYBER BOSS CHARACTER INTRODUCTION
CYBER BOSS, an ageless,
faceless,
voiceless,
genderless,
world-roaming cloud
which transmits instructions
to the smart phones of any
willing or unwilling recipient

- CYBER BOSS ALERT EFFECT
Stereotype sci-fi electric gizmo or radio sounds
emit from the [Cyber Boss] cloud,
and a stream of blue wavy "radio" lines
and small stereotype thunder bolt symbols
emanate from it
and enter the recipient's phone.
[The recipient does not need to be in
apparent range of the cloud, nor does
the cloud need to visibly appear.]

CYBER BOB UNIVERSE LICENSE AND PURPOSE.
The Cyber Bob Universe is a dramatic concept and collection of
creative works which are all expressly and irrevocably dedicated
to the Public Domain, by anyone who contributes to the project.

This is to encourage free creative play, commercialization,
or anything else hinging off the creative works.

Especially, it is to encourage anyone to create anything at any
level of skill from low-end amateur video to high-end, for example
anything from using simple hand drawn cartoons or CGI to professional
staging and effects, and also in a spirit of very open adaptation for
any purpose, including very flexibly altering the ages, ethnicities,
and genders of characters--maybe even their names ("BOB" could for
example be changed to "BARBARA").

COLLECTED SCREENPLAYS ETC.
A git repository folder of these screenplays which anyone may
contribute to is at:
