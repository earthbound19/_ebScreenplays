Cyber Bob follows an order to make the best use of asparagus concrete. He finds a local burial in process and intrudes on the graveyard to pour a dumptruck full of asparagus concrete on to the coffin, catafalque and all, and the family is moved to tears of gratitude and thanks him, noting that the deceased was a vegetarian and asked to be buried in asparagus concrete but they could not afford it.
