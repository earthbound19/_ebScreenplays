## A collection of Public Domain screenplays

This is a collection of original screenplays dedicated to the Public Domain so that anyone can use them for any (ethical) purpose. Contributions to this collection are welcome. This is not intended as a general library of screenplays which happen to be in the Public Domain through copyright expiry or neglect. It is intended as a library of screenplays which are new at the time they are submitted to the library, and which are original. Adaptations of works in the Public Domain (which were not originally screenplays) are also welcome.

### Contributions

I hope to add specific commands/steps to these instructions for people new to git, but in brief:

- Clone this repo.
- Create a new, original screenplay in it, in [fountain format](https://fountain.io/). Copy and use [screenplay_template.fountain](screenplay_template.fountain) as a template, rewriting and renaming it to your screenplay.
- Expressly dedicate the work you submit to the public domain in the copyright section of the fountain text source itself. If you do not do this your pull request will be rejected. Only dedicate it to the Public Domain  if you actually had legal copyright control of the work before dedicating it to the Public Domain (for example, if it is an original work which you wrote yourself).
- Only create new files and avoid name conflicts. For works with the same title, avoid conflicts by adding random characters like `eDbJcR` or `uTY4T6` to the end of the file name (before the `.fountain` extension).
- Open a pull request.

## Creative writing?!

I claim to [know some stuff that I can pass along](https://github.com/earthbound19/screenplay_art_and_craft), which I learned from great teachers, but I'm "nobody."
